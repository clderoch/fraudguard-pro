## Company Description

### Problem Statement

Small and medium-sized businesses face significant financial losses from payment fraud and chargebacks:

- **Chargeback Fees**: $15-100+ per incident, regardless of dispute outcome
- **Lost Revenue**: 2.5x the transaction amount on average when including fees, lost goods, and processing costs
- **Increased Processing Rates**: Payment processors raise rates for merchants with high chargeback ratios
- **Time Investment**: Hours spent disputing chargebacks with limited success rates
- **Cash Flow Impact**: Immediate revenue loss while disputes are resolved

**Market Gap**: Current fraud prevention solutions are either:
- Too expensive for SMBs (enterprise solutions cost $10K+ monthly)
- Too basic (simple velocity checks and blacklists)
- Require significant technical integration resources
- Lack the sophistication to catch evolving fraud patterns

### Solution Overview

FraudGuard Pro bridges this gap by providing:

1. **Accessible Technology**: Web-based platform requiring no technical integration
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning models trained on millions of transactions
3. **SMB-Focused Pricing**: Affordable subscription tiers starting at $99/month
4. **Actionable Insights**: Clear risk scores and recommended actions
5. **Continuous Learning**: Models improve with each customer's transaction history
